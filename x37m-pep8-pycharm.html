                            <p> I installed python and i tought it would be allready in some kind of editor, but its just in cmd. Is there like specific editor for that? If yes could you recommend I'm currently working my way through Python Crash Course as a complete programming beginner and really enjoying it. I'm using Geany, as that was recommended at the start of the book, but also have access to PyCharm as a student and was wondering if there are any benefits/drawbacks to switching to that or VS Code etc. Geany is working fine for now, but I assume eventually I'll want to move to a different IDE and was wondering if sooner is better to switch, to learn in the environment Hello! I'm a novice when it comes to working with python, so I apologize for the extremely basic question. The IDE I am using (pyCharm) is giving me a PEP 8 error (line too long). For a lot of the code I am working on. I understand that this isn't a hard constraint of python. Just something to improve readability, which I would like to do. Currently I have a line (below) that shoots way off the screen, and it is just annoying to make changes to it. I can't figure out how to spread I know the basics- functions, loops, import and use libraries yada yada. I am now wanting to code right- How do I structure my python project? Are there holy guidelines that I can easily follow? How do people store configuration information like database servers, username, password in a python project? How do I manage dependencies? I listed them out in requirements.txt but also found setup.py articles. Which is preferable? How do I start writing test suites? Are there tools I am having trouble with formatting a dir of python code with a certain standard style. Are there any good tools and/or plugins in PyCharm Hey, I've been working in pycharm quite a bit and as a result of pep8 integration I now write much more compliant code simply because I got tired of the IDE yelling at me. Does anyone know of an equivalent for intelliJ. 
I'm currently learning python by myself, mostly by a mix of online tutorials and 'learning by doing'. I fear however, that I might fall into the trap of ending up with bad coding behaviours, which one might expect from self-taught programmers (if pyramids of doom, not naming variables and functions according to conventions, documentation, etc.) I know that 'learning python in a week' is a lot more appealing to most people, and that having fast results is what many wish for, but I personally. Many of you are probably aware of PEP8 which is style guide for coding in Python. But most of you might be unaware that there is a tool called PEP8 which can be installed via pip as- pip install pep8 After installing it, you can check whether your code confirms to PEP8 by running this command- pep8 test.py Here test.py is your program. And it will tell you how you can make your code look great by pointing out mistakes line by line. (Source: Python Guide by Kenneth Reitz). Awesome. I've been using PyCharm ( for a few months now, and I've been thoroughly impressed with it. What does everyone So before I rewrite everything, I have a pretty comprehensive writeup of my problem: ok so I'm working on: and I am using this code to eventually do a breadth first search on a coordinate plane: https://gist.github.com/emcenrue/5d8edd64b09488035f77 Unfortunately, my pointers/references don't seem to be getting replaced. Like many python beginners, one of my first projects was a text game. At first, I had these very long strings of text mixed in with all my code. It was fine at first, until the game got larger and I started following pep8. Then I started breaking the lines down into 79 characters, and after while it became very hard to read the actual code. The strings kinda dominated everything. So then I decided to put all my strings into an imported module. In fact, a couple different modules in the project. В продолжение https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikabu/comments/bfm5pz/на\_волне\_про\_работу/?utm\_source=share Все началось с того, что я сидел на телефоне технической поддержки уже пару лет на одом месте и перспектив на улучшение не было от слова совсем. Хотелось заниматься более полезным, а не просиживать штаны, да и доход уве. These two plugins (https://imgur.com/a/crCP2bl) provide real-time and on-demand code inspection from within PyCharm/IDEA. The real-time code inspection works automatically the same way like the PyCharm's build-in on the fly PEP8 check (you see the issues highlighted directly in your code while typing). The on-demand inspection has several options that go from just scanning the current file to scan the entire project. They also offer an option to run a check on the modified files before I started writing Python scripts with regular IDLE. Very clean, very basic. I could open a py script, or a few more - and start with coding. And a lot of trial and error and a lot of google for syntax issues. Now I switched to PyCharm. Mainly because of the help it generates, the check for mistakes and PEP8 guidelines. Also keyboard shortcuts for intend a whole block etc. I believe I could do more stuff with PyCharm dan with the clean IDLE. It turns out PyCharm. 
Hi there, I started a student job in a small data science department. My colleagues are all using Jupyter Notebooks. I find Jupyter quite helpful when I'm just working with data, manipulating and visualizing it. But I feel I'm missing some key features I learned to love so much when using pyCharm. Particularly I'm missing the possibility to look up online documentaries, declarations, debugging and pep8 checking. Is it possible to get such features into Jupyter or would you suggest that I develop. # Problem I'm reasonably proficient in python but naive when it comes to understanding how to properly manage packages and dependencies. At the moment, I have a few common codes I've placed in a git repository that I include as a subtree in many of my projects. I'd rather have many local versioned copies than one big library added to PATH just so I can avoid breaking all my projects as I develop my library. # Attempt at Solution I've been using PyCharm and trying to adhere to PEP8. Basically I've started using PyCharm for my python projects and by default it will notify you if you are doing something not according to PEP8. While I noticed I definitely wasn't following PEP8 and had my own coding style, having this feature made it easy for me to learn and adapt my coding style. Now for future collaborations I can just ask co-workers to generally follow PEP8. Our company is small but getting a little larger where collaboration may become necessary and I'd like to start enfor. 
I'm in pycharm, and after changing my program up so it works not only on windows, I have some variables highlighted with this warning: "Expected type 'Union\ bytes, str\ ', got 'Path' instead". If my description sucks, here's my github: https://github.com/jeffdavidcrockett/TradeCompanion-V1 (https://github.com/jeffdavidcrockett/TradeCompanion-V1) So basically, I have an initial\_startup function that starts out, and it gets the path from the user so data files can be created and stored I know this is a really broad question, so I'll try to simplify. In order to avoid Googling 100 different tutorials, I'd like one straight path. A learning path example, if you will. I also know that everyone has their own opionons and reservations, but there is no wrong answer. I'll figure out my own way of learning this as I get more in depth, but since I'm just looking for a place to start, any direction would be much appreciated. For example, if someone were to ask me how to approach learn.
