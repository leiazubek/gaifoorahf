After the latest game updates, I noticed a substantial drop in performance on both ETS2 and ATS on my desktop PC. I used to get over 60 FPS on roads and between 45-50 in cities in a triple monitor setup (5760x1080) with high-ultra settings, and after the patch I was barely making 40 FPS on the road and 20-30 in cities, even on a single monit.

My hack will randomly reboot itself during light or heavy loads; It doesn't matter wether many apps are open, or none at all, you just have to wait 2-20mins and it will shut down. It definately seems to happen faster under heavy loads though.

The following actions have been taken already. -Restart the device (several times) -Uninstall.
